This project aims to implement and test the famous Timothy \mbox{\hyperlink{classChan}{Chan}}\textquotesingle{}s algorithm for Convex Hull computation.

\subsection*{Introduction}

\subsubsection*{Convex Hull}

A convex hull of a given set of points is a minimal convex polygon which contains all the points within it.

\subsubsection*{Related Algorithms}

Convex Hull computation is a very well studied and important problem in computational geometry. It has many real world applications which makes worthy to be sought after.

Some of the other well known algorithms for convex hull are\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Jarvis March (Gift wrapping) algorithm $\vert$ {\ttfamily O(n $\ast$ h)}
\item Graham Scan algorithm $\vert$ {\ttfamily O(n log n)}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Here, {\ttfamily n} is the number of points in the input and {\ttfamily h} is the number of points in the output convex hull.

\subsubsection*{Algorithm \& Complexity}

\mbox{\hyperlink{classChan}{Chan}}\textquotesingle{}s algorithm is inspired by both {\ttfamily Graham Scan} and {\ttfamily Jarvis March}. It uses the ideas from both the algorithms to acheive the asymptotically optimal time complexity of {\ttfamily O(n log h)} where {\ttfamily n} is the number of points in the input and {\ttfamily h} is the number of points on the output convex hull. Here, since the complexity depends on the output hence, it is a output sensitive algorithm. Note, {\ttfamily h $<$= n} Hence, \mbox{\hyperlink{classChan}{Chan}}\textquotesingle{}s algorithm is atleast as good as {\ttfamily Graham Scan}.

Moreover, if {\ttfamily h \textbackslash{}in o(n)} then \mbox{\hyperlink{classChan}{Chan}}\textquotesingle{}s algorithms is asymptotically better than {\ttfamily Graham Scan}.

\subsubsection*{How to run}

\paragraph*{Compilation}

To compile the programs use the corresponding make command\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}

\item Graham Scan algorithm \+: {\ttfamily make graham}
\item Jarvis March \+: {\ttfamily make jarvis}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\paragraph*{Execution}

Execute the code by giving an input via console or through input file.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./main\_chan < ./tests/inputs/t0.txt}
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsubsection*{Run tests}
